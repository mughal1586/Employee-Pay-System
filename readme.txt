-   Calculates the yearly salary of an employee.
-   Implements a function to give employees a 10% raise.
-   Demonstrates setting employee data and displaying employee information.

-   `header.h`:  Contains the declaration of the `Employee` class. [cite: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
-   `Employee Pay System.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the `Employee` class methods. [cite: 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]
-   `main.cpp`: Contains the main function that uses the `Employee` class to create employee objects, set their data, and display their information. [cite: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
